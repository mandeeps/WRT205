	<h1>The Culture of Computer Science</h1>
	<img src="images/nyancat.gif" width=90%>
	
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h1>WTF is CS Anyways???</h1>
    <p>What do you think Computer Science is about?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Fixing Computers?</li>
    <li>Coding Apps?</li>
    <li>Hacking?</li>
    <li>Losing All Your Money on Dogecoin???</li>
    <li>Could ask GPT and learn about CS from a CS project...</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Computer Science isn't (really) About Computers</h1>
		<p>CS is about computers the way biology is about microscopes, astronomy is about telescopes, or writing is about pens.</p>
		<p>It's not Information Technology, although it helps to know how to fix a computer.</p>
		<p>It's not "coding", that's what your patients would be if you were a doctor.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<p>We use math, but CS is not a branch of math</p>
<img src="images/linear-algebra.png" width=90%>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Computer Science is about <i>Problem Solving</i></h2>

<p>Computers are just a tool to make problem solving easier</p>

<ul>
<p>People: Smart(not me tho) but Slow</p>
<li>Take too long to do math, too easy to make mistakes</li>
</ul>
<p>Computers: Dumb but Very Fast</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can do lots of math really quick and remember lots of variables
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Algorithms: Recipes for Problem Solving</h2>

<p>How would you search through security footage to find the time a break-in happened in the middle of the night?</p>
<ul>
<li>A - Start watching from the beginning until you see it happen</li>
<li>B - Skip through the video randomly until you see the break-in</li>
<li>C - Any Other Bright Ideas?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h3>Divide and Conquer Algorithm</h3>
Reduce the Problem Space: You have 12 hours of security footage to search through?
<ul>
<li>Start Halfway (6 hours): Do you see broken glass? Jump to half the first half (3 hours in)</li>
<li>No broken glass? Skip to halfway through the rest of the video (9 hours in)</li>
</ul>
Keep reducing the possible timeline the break-in occurred by half until you determine the exact time
</div>

<div class="slide">
<p>There are different algorithms for different problems.</p>
<p>Understanding the trade-offs different algorithms make in terms of things like:</p>
<ul><li>the time they take</li>
<li>the resources they require</li>
<li>how they scale as the problem gets bigger</li>
</ul>
is an important part of Computer Science.
<p>Understanding how to store information (Data Structures) is another.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Computers only really understand 1's and 0's - too much effort for people to understand</p>
<p>Programming languages are tools to make telling computers what to do easier, learning programming is a means to an end.</p>
<p>Computer Science majors learn programming, but it's just another tool for problem-solving</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
Programming can be a useful skill for anyone
My sister is a lawyer, learned basic commands to get information from company database and search through it
Saved a ton of time, didn't have to wait for IT to get around to it
Automate tasks
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Start with Python if you're interested</h2>

<div class="slide">
CS class at Syracuse
I can't give  you a ton of info on CS at SU specifically, because this is my first semester BUT
Major requirements, info from website
size of classes, # of students
18 credits upper-level electives - wide range of topics to specialize into
</div>

<div class="slide">
lots of theory, but practical experience at SU too

research at SU, tier 1 research university
SU events CS majors participate in: hackathons, invent upstate, clubs for everything from drones to blockchain
</div>

<div class="slide">
Cryptography is a topic CS majors can study
SU Cybersecurity club and classes
Part of Cybersecurity
haveibeenpwnded demo
</div>

<p>Copy-paste into rot13.org</p>
<p>First person to decrypt the message gets a prize!</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
What's the prize???
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>There is no prize, I lied.</h2>
<img src="images/lie.jpg" width=50%>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>After Graduation</h2>
research, software development, 
"software eating the world"
tech that makes programming easier tends to increase demand for programmers
</div>

<div class="slide">
Culture
details matter, 1 character in the wrong place can break your software
determination: make the damn thing work
cooperation: free/open source software, team projects, most working software developers are part of a team
info from Marum
info from interviews
- email other students for quotes?

futurism, love of novelty and new stuff
Students always talking about the latest tech trends
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Weird sense of humor in CS culture</h2> thought it was worth commenting on
Prof Marum's jokes
GNU & other acronyms, weird programming languages
</div>
<div class="slide">
<p>Brainf**k: This is a real programming language, created by a real programmer</p>
<img src="images/brainfuck.png">
</div>

<div class="slide">
<p>A programmer got tired of jobs asking for "rockstar programmers" so they made a language called Rockstar where all the code reads like nonsensical song lyrics</p>
<img src="images/rockstar.png">
</div>

<div class="slide">
<p>Programming is a creative expression of computer science. More of an art than it looks like</p>
